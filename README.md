# TicTacToe-with-DataClasses

Interactive TicTacToe game supporting multiple players. I used it as a learning project and updated it every time I learned new Python features. I started with NORMAL CLASSES (including inheritance and composition), then moved on to DATA CLASSES.
I initially envisioned the game as a single one (still with multiple rounds) that does not require the possible creation of multiple instances of the game itself, so in the 'SINGLE-GAME' file you will see CLASS variables instead of INSTANCE ones.
I later decided to allow for the creation of multiple Game objects and I adjusted the code accordingly in the 'MULTIPLE-GAMES' file. 
In both versions the features of the game remain unchanged. 

# Features
-3 game modes:
 -Human vs Human
 -Human vs Computer (interactive choice of who goes first and with which symbol)
 -Computer vs Computer 
-Score and rounds tracking
-Option to change players after each round and the score and rounds change accordingly
